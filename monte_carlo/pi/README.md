# Estimating PI Using Monte Carlo Method

This simulation will be determining the probability that a random point on a square also lies within a circle fitted to that square. The expected probability of the point lying within the circle is equivalent to the area of the circle divided by the area of all possible points, the square. 

`P(Circle) = &Pi;r<sup>2</sup> / 4r<sup>2</sup>`

We can use this notion to then get the value of pi:

`&Pi; = r<sup>2</sup> / (4r<sup>2</sup> * P(Circle))`
